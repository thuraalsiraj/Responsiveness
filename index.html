    <h1>Put the glass down now</h1>

    <p>
        A professor began his class by holding up a glass with
        some water in it.
        He held it up for all to see; asked the students,’ How much
        do you think this glass weighs?’
        ’50gms!’ …. ‘100gms!’ ……’125gms’ ……the students answered.
        ‘I really don’t know unless I weigh it,’ said the professor,
        ‘but, my question is:
        What would happen if I held it up like this for a few minutes?’
        ‘Nothing’ the students said.
        ‘Ok what would happen if I held it up
        like this for an hour? ‘ the professor asked.
        ‘Your arm would begin to ache’ said one of the students.
        ‘You’re right, now what would happen if I held it for a day? ‘
        ‘Your arm could go numb, you might have severe muscle
        stress; paralysis;
        have to go to hospital for sure!’ventured another student;
        all the students laughed.
        ‘Very good. But during all this, did the weight of the
        glass change?’ asked the professor.
        ‘No’ the students said.
        Then what caused the arm ache & the muscle stress? ‘
        The students were puzzled.
        ‘Put the glass down!’ said one of the students.
        ‘Exactly!’ said the professor.’ Life’s problems are
        something like this .
        Hold it for a few minutes in your head; they seem OK.
        Think of them for a long time & they begin to ache.
        Hold it even longer & they begin to paralyze you. You will
        not be able to do anything.
        It’s important to think of the challenges (problems) in your
        life,but
        EVEN MORE IMPORTANT to ‘put them down’ at the end of
        every day before you go to sleep.
        That way, you are not stressed, you wake up every day
        fresh & strong & can handle any issue, any challenge that

    <h3>  Failing Fishing Attempt </h3>
    <p> Last weekend I was bored and I had nothing to do. all my friends and family members were busy, so no one was able to spent time with me. I started thinking "what can i do ?" and suddenly i came up with idea... I can go finshing i  took my fishing rod, hooks, and worms for bait. I reached the jetty and threw the line with the bait into the water and started waiting. there were too many other fishermen. they were all happy, catching a lot of fishes. meanwhile I was sitting frustrated as I couldn’t catch a single fish! .. and I was wondering why I can’t catch some fish and be happy like them after few hours the fishermen started to leave one by one. and eventually I remained alone with an empty bucket. I felt so sad, but after a while I looked at the horizon to see the sunset! it was an amazing scene and a group of seagulls were flying, singing over the golden light of the sun that was reflected on the water Then I felt a great happiness deep inside! I was the only one seeing that view and then i realized that happiness can come in different ways and different ways different reasons.

        . He came to his father and told him what he had achieved His father was with his efforts and said to him: “But now my son, you have to take out a nail for every day that you do not get The son started to take out the nails for each day that he did not get , until there were no nails left in the   fence He came to his father and told him what he had achieved ,His father took him to the fence and said, “My son you have done well, but look at these holes in the fence,This fence will never be the same again.” Then he  added When you say things in a state of anger, they leave marks like these holes on the hearts of others,You can    stab a person and withdraw the knife but it doesn’t matter how many times you say ‘I’m sorry,’ because the wound will remain </p>
